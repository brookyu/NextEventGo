}

func (a *AuthService) ValidateToken(tokenString string) (*CustomClaims, error) {
    // Enhanced validation with blacklist checking and constant-time comparison
    token, err := jwt.ParseWithClaims(tokenString, &CustomClaims{}, 
        func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
            return a.secretKey, nil
        })

    request := &CreateEventRequest{
        Title:     "Benchmark Event",
        StartDate: time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour),
        EndDate:   time.Now().Add(26 * time.Hour),
    }

    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        _, err := service.CreateEvent(context.Background(), request)
        if err != nil {

- WeChat webhook configurations maintained without platform changes required
- Redis and RabbitMQ integration patterns preserved through Go-native clients
- JWT token compatibility ensuring session continuity during migration

**Clear Implementation Sequencing:**
- Stories must ensure existing functionality remains intact at each step
- Each story includes Integration Verification steps validating system integrity
- Migration risk minimized through sequential validation and rollback capabilities
- Performance monitoring required at each story completion to validate improvement targets

This architecture ensures that each story implementation maintains existing system integrity while progressively building toward the complete Golang migration with enhanced performance and modern admin interface capabilities.

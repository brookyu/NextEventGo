# NextEvent Go v2 - Missing Features Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for adding the missing features from the original .NET NextEvent system to the new Go-based architecture. The plan follows the current project's Clean Architecture patterns and maintains compatibility with the existing database schema.

## Current Project Architecture

The NextEvent Go v2 project follows these architectural patterns:
- **Clean Architecture** with domain-driven design
- **Go backend** using Gin framework with GORM v2
- **React frontend** with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- **MySQL database** with existing entities (User, SiteEvent, EventAttendee, WeChatMessage)
- **WeChat integration** with silenceper/wechat/v2
- **Redis caching** for performance optimization

## Missing Features Analysis

Based on the documentation in `docs/added_docs/`, the following major feature systems need to be implemented:

### 1. Image Management System
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive media file handling with WeChat integration
- **Key Features**: File upload, storage, organization, WeChat media API integration
- **Complexity**: Medium (foundational for other features)

### 2. Article Management System  
- **Purpose**: Complete content creation, publishing, and analytics
- **Key Features**: Rich content editor, QR code generation, analytics tracking, promotion codes
- **Complexity**: High (complex business logic and analytics)

### 3. Survey Management System
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive survey platform with real-time analytics
- **Key Features**: Multiple question types, live results, WebSocket integration, advanced reporting
- **Complexity**: Very High (real-time features and complex data relationships)

### 4. News Management System
- **Purpose**: Multi-article news publication with WeChat integration
- **Key Features**: Article aggregation, WeChat draft API, content transformation
- **Complexity**: High (complex WeChat integration)

### 5. Video Management System
- **Purpose**: Video content and cloud streaming with analytics
- **Key Features**: Live streaming, session tracking, heat maps, cloud integration
- **Complexity**: Very High (streaming infrastructure and real-time analytics)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach
The implementation follows a dependency-based approach where foundational features are built first:

1. **Image Management** (Foundation for content features)
2. **Article Management** (Core content feature)
3. **Survey Management** (Independent complex feature)
4. **News Management** (Depends on articles)
5. **Video Management** (Most complex, can be implemented last)

### Architecture Alignment
Each feature will be implemented following the current project patterns:

- **Domain Layer**: `internal/domain/entities/` with GORM tags matching .NET schema
- **Application Layer**: `internal/app/` with business logic and use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: `internal/infrastructure/` with external integrations
- **Interface Layer**: `internal/interfaces/` with REST API controllers
- **Frontend Layer**: `web/` with React components and TypeScript

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Throughout the implementation, the following concerns must be addressed:

### Infrastructure Enhancements
- Enhance WeChat service for comprehensive integration
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Add proper authorization middleware with granular permissions
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

### Quality Assurance
- Create comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI)
- Add integration and end-to-end tests
- Implement proper caching strategies with Redis
- Add database performance optimizations

### Security & Performance
- Implement role-based access control
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Add monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Compatibility
- Maintain exact compatibility with existing .NET database schema
- Use PascalCase table and column names
- Preserve UUID primary keys and audit field patterns
- Ensure foreign key relationships match existing structure

### WeChat Integration
- Extend existing WeChat service for new features
- Implement QR code generation for all content types
- Add media upload capabilities for images and videos

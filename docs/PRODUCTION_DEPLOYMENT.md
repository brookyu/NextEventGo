## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment Process

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Deploy new version to staging environment
   - Run comprehensive testing suite
   - Validate performance benchmarks
   - Prepare rollback procedures

2. **Deployment Phase**
   - Deploy new version to production (green environment)
   - Keep existing version running (blue environment)
   - Perform health checks and smoke tests
   - Gradually shift traffic from blue to green

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Monitor key performance indicators
   - Validate business functionality
   - Check error rates and response times
   - Confirm cost optimization targets

4. **Cutover Phase**
   - Complete traffic migration to green environment
   - Monitor for 24 hours minimum
   - Decommission blue environment after validation
   - Update DNS and external integrations

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Targets

### Throughput Targets
- Concurrent users: 10,000+
- API requests per second: 1,000+
- Database connections: 500+
- WeChat messages per minute: 1,000+

### Availability Targets
- System uptime: 99.9%
- Database availability: 99.95%
- API availability: 99.9%
- Frontend availability: 99.9%

## Cost Optimization Targets

### Infrastructure Cost Reduction

- Resource utilization tracking
- Cost allocation by service and environment

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
- Deploy Kubernetes cluster
- Configure monitoring and logging
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy staging environment

### Phase 2: Application Deployment (Week 2)
- Deploy application to staging
- Run comprehensive testing
- Performance validation
- Security testing

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Week 3)
- Deploy to production environment
- Configure blue-green deployment
- Initial traffic routing (0% to new system)
- Monitoring and validation

### Phase 4: Gradual Cutover (Week 4)
- Day 1: 10% traffic to new system
- Day 2: 25% traffic to new system
- Day 3: 50% traffic to new system
- Day 4: 75% traffic to new system
- Day 5: 100% traffic to new system

### Phase 5: Legacy Decommission (Week 5)
- Monitor new system for 1 week at 100% traffic
- Validate all functionality and performance
- Decommission legacy .NET system
- Update documentation and procedures

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time P95 > 200ms for 10 minutes
- Database connection failures > 10% for 2 minutes
- Critical business function failures

### Manual Rollback Process
1. Set traffic routing to 0% for new system
2. Validate legacy system health
3. Restore database to pre-migration state if needed
4. Update monitoring and alerting
5. Investigate and document issues

### Rollback Time Targets
- Traffic routing rollback: < 2 minutes
- Full system rollback: < 15 minutes
- Database rollback: < 30 minutes

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Application performance (response times, throughput)
- Infrastructure health (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business metrics (user registrations, event creation, WeChat interactions)
- Cost metrics (resource usage, billing data)

### Alert Thresholds
- Critical: System unavailable, data loss risk
- Warning: Performance degradation, resource constraints
- Info: Deployment events, configuration changes

### Escalation Procedures
1. Level 1: Development team (immediate response)
2. Level 2: Operations team (15 minutes)
3. Level 3: Management team (30 minutes)
4. Level 4: External support (1 hour)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
☑️ **Technology Stack Migration** (Primary)  
☑️ **Performance/Scalability Improvements**  
☑️ **Integration with New Systems** (Golang ecosystem)  
☑️ **UI/UX Modernization** (Admin Interface)

**Enhancement Description:**
Complete migration from .NET/ABP Framework to Golang-based architecture while maintaining 100% functional parity of all WeChat integrations, event management capabilities, and user workflows. Additionally, modernize the admin interface with responsive design and real-time capabilities. This includes preserving existing MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ infrastructure while modernizing both application and presentation layers.

**Impact Assessment:**
☑️ **Major Impact** (architectural changes required) - Complete technology stack replacement with UI modernization

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• **Performance Excellence:** 50-70% reduction in API response times (target: <100ms)
• **Infrastructure Cost Reduction:** 30-40% reduction in Aliyun operational costs
• **Deployment Simplification:** Single binary deployment with <1 minute deploy time
• **Operational Reliability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime with enhanced concurrency handling
• **Feature Preservation:** 100% functional parity with current WeChat integration capabilities
• **Team Productivity:** 50% reduction in developer onboarding time through simplified architecture
• **Admin UX Enhancement:** Modern, responsive admin interface with real-time monitoring capabilities

**Background Context:**
The current system faces performance bottlenecks (150-300ms response times), operational complexity (3-5 minute deployments), and high resource consumption (~500MB per service). The migration to Golang represents a strategic modernization to address these challenges while leveraging Go's superior concurrency model for WeChat's high-volume message processing requirements. Simultaneously modernizing the admin interface provides enhanced user experience and operational visibility. This experimental approach allows validation of Golang's suitability for enterprise WeChat applications.

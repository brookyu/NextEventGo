## ðŸ‘¥ Development Team Engagement Prompts

### **Backend Development Team**

```
@backend-dev I'm handing off the WeChat Event Management System migration from .NET to Golang. Please review the complete architecture at docs/architecture.md and begin with Story 1: Core Domain Layer Implementation. The architecture provides detailed Golang struct definitions, GORM configurations, and API endpoint specifications. Focus on maintaining 100% functional parity with the existing .NET system while leveraging Go's performance advantages.

Key priorities:
1. Start with domain models (SiteEvent, User, WeChat integration entities)
2. Implement WeChat webhook processing with silenceper/wechat v2
3. Maintain identical API contracts for seamless cutover
4. Follow the blue-green deployment strategy outlined in the architecture
```

### **Frontend Development Team**

```
@frontend-dev The WeChat system migration includes modernizing the admin interface with responsive design and real-time capabilities. Please review docs/prd.md Section 3 (UI Enhancement Goals) and docs/architecture.md Section 6 (API Design) to understand the new admin interface requirements.

Key deliverables:
1. Responsive admin dashboard with real-time system monitoring
2. Modern event management interface with improved UX workflows
3. WeChat integration status monitoring dashboard
4. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile admin access
```

### **DevOps/Infrastructure Team**

```
@devops-team Please review the Infrastructure and Deployment Integration section in docs/architecture.md. We need to implement the blue-green deployment strategy on Aliyun infrastructure to enable zero-downtime migration from .NET to Golang.

Implementation requirements:
1. Parallel Golang container deployment alongside existing .NET services
2. Load balancer configuration for gradual traffic migration (10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
3. Monitoring and rollback procedures at each migration phase
4. Database migration tooling and validation scripts
```

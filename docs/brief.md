# Project Brief: WeChat Event Management System Migration to Golang

**Project Type:** Legacy System Migration & Modernization  
**Created:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This project involves migrating a sophisticated WeChat-based event management system from .NET/ABP Framework to a modern Golang tech stack. The current system successfully handles WeChat Public Account integrations, Mini App authentication, Enterprise WeChat (WeCom) messaging, and comprehensive event management workflows. The migration aims to leverage Golang's superior performance characteristics, simplified deployment model, and reduced operational complexity while maintaining all existing WeChat integration capabilities. This is positioned as a step-by-step experimental approach to validate Golang's viability for enterprise WeChat applications, with deployment targeting Aliyun cloud infrastructure.

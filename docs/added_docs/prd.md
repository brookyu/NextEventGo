• **WeChat Ecosystem Mastery**: Deliver comprehensive WeChat integration with QR codes, OAuth, template messaging, and real-time interaction tracking  
• **Modern Full-Stack Experience**: Provide React-based admin interface with TypeScript and mobile-optimized WeChat frontend with Progressive Web App capabilities
• **Zero-Risk Migration**: Maintain complete functional parity with existing .NET system while preserving MySQL schema and ensuring seamless data transition
• **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Implement Clean Architecture patterns with hexagonal design, comprehensive monitoring, and robust security through JWT authentication
• **Real-Time Analytics**: Enable live event management, survey results, and performance dashboards with WebSocket integration across the full stack

### Background Context
The NextEvent Go System represents a strategic migration from a sophisticated .NET 9/ABP Framework platform to a modern Go-based full-stack architecture. The existing system already demonstrates enterprise-grade capabilities including content management (articles, news, surveys), live streaming with Alibaba Cloud, comprehensive WeChat ecosystem integration, and real-time analytics with business intelligence.

This migration addresses performance bottlenecks while expanding capabilities through Go's concurrency advantages, modern React/TypeScript frontend development, and optimized cloud-native deployment on Aliyun infrastructure. The system serves Chinese market requirements with WeChat-first design patterns, ensuring regulatory compliance and network optimization through Aliyun's China-based services while maintaining the sophisticated feature set that includes multi-language support, advanced user engagement tools, and comprehensive event management workflows.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The NextEvent Go System embraces a **dual-interface philosophy** designed for sophisticated enterprise administration and seamless WeChat user engagement. The admin interface follows **modern enterprise design principles** with data-dense dashboards, real-time analytics visualization, and efficient workflow management using React + TypeScript + Ant Design components. The WeChat frontend prioritizes **mobile-first progressive web app experience** with instant loading, offline capabilities, and native-feeling interactions optimized for Chinese mobile usage patterns.

The unified experience ensures **consistent branding and user mental models** across both interfaces while respecting the distinct usage contexts - power users need comprehensive controls and analytics, while WeChat users need streamlined, touch-optimized interactions for content consumption and survey participation.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Real-time Collaborative Dashboard**: Live updating charts, metrics, and notifications with WebSocket integration for immediate feedback and shared situational awareness
- **Touch-First Mobile Interactions**: WeChat frontend optimized for thumb navigation, swipe gestures, and single-handed operation with large touch targets
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex admin features revealed gradually through intuitive navigation while maintaining quick access to frequently used functions
- **Contextual Action Panels**: Right-side panels and modal overlays for detailed operations without losing main workflow context
- **Live Survey Interaction**: Real-time voting and result visualization with smooth animations and immediate feedback for engagement
- **QR Code Integration**: Seamless QR code scanning and generation workflows bridging physical and digital experiences

### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time system overview with key metrics, active events, and navigation hub
- **Event Management Interface**: Comprehensive event creation, editing, and analytics with live participant tracking
- **WeChat Integration Center**: QR code management, template message configuration, and WeChat service health monitoring

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- **User Research Validation**: While business context is clear, explicit user persona validation and research findings would strengthen the foundation
- **Problem Quantification**: Current problem impact could be more specific with metrics (e.g., current system performance bottlenecks)

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- **Explicit Out-of-Scope**: While scope is well-defined, explicitly documenting what's NOT included would prevent scope creep
- **MVP Learning Goals**: More specific criteria for measuring MVP success and moving beyond MVP

**LOW Priority:**
- **Competitive Analysis**: Brief competitive landscape analysis would strengthen market context
- **Stakeholder Communication Plan**: Formal communication plan for ongoing updates

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriately Scoped Features:**
- ✅ Foundation infrastructure with working authentication (Epic 1)
- ✅ Core event management with real-time analytics (Epic 2)  
- ✅ Content management with WeChat integration (Epic 3)
- ✅ Survey system with live interaction capabilities (Epic 4)
- ✅ Admin interface with production deployment (Epic 5)

**Potential Complexity Concerns:**
- **Real-time Broadcasting (Epic 4)**: Advanced live survey features might be complex for MVP
- **Collaborative Editing (Epic 3)**: Real-time collaboration could be simplified for initial release
- **Advanced Analytics**: Sentiment analysis and statistical testing might be over-engineered

**Timeline Realism**: 
5 epics over 10-12 weeks appears realistic given comprehensive scope and AI agent execution model
